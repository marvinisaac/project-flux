- Player starts in a small farming village
- Specializations:
    - Combat
        - AFK/offline mode results in experience
    - Farming, mining, fishing, forestry
        - AFK/offline mode results in basic ingredients
    - Commerce
        - AFK/offline mode results in currency
- Stamina
    - Based on VIT
    - Big weapons = more stamina, more damage, slow attack speed
    - Small weapons = less stamina, less damage, more attack speed
- Areas
    - Moving inside an area takes no time
        - Inside the village, movement is instant
    - Moving to a different area takes time
        - Going from the village to the nearby woods takes time
- Movement

- Grid-based world
    - Movement is via WASD, arrows, or click (https://writtenrealms.com/)
    - Stamina limits how far/fast a character can move
    - Distances are relatively realistic
    - Map zooms in/out depending on the current location and/or player preference
        - Player can zoom out and set a long distance travel by foot that would take a long time
        - Inside a city, street-level view is the default
        - Inside a castle, some large, individual items can be seen on the map (door, chest, furniture, etc)
- Combat is flexible
    - Turn-based for more tactical feel
    - Automatic for idle-ish gameplay
- World constantly shifts (ie quantum fluctuation) so much so that some locations pop in and out of existence seemingly randomly
- "Bubbles" exists where things are relatively stable, this is where cities, towns, and villages are formed
